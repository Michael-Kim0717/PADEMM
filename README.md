PADEMM is short for "Puzzle and Dragons Evolution Material Manager".

In short, PADEMM is an app made for Japan's highly popular puzzle game, "Puzzle and Dragons".

The game's structure makes it fairly difficult to keep track of which materials you require on a regular basis.

This application's main goal is to show you which evolution materials you will need (even for sub-units), show how close you are to evolving a unit (based on the amount of materials you own), and prioritize certain units over others.
